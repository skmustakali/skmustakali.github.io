Welcome to my homepage!
I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Cyclotron Institute, Texas A&M University. I am working with the low-energy experimental nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics group led by Prof. Grigory Rogachev.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), Michigan State University, working with the Charge-Exchange group led by Prof. Remco Zegers. My work primarily focused on investigating the spin-isospin response of the nuclei via charge-exchange reactions and their astrophysical applications.

I pursued my Ph.D. from Bose Institute, Kolkata under the supervision of Prof. Dhruba Gupta. My doctoral work involved studying nuclear reactions relevant to the Cosmological Lithium Problem (CLiP). The experiment to measure the cross sections of these reactions was carried out at ISOLDE, CERN. 

Feel free to browse the various sections to check my academic pursuits and research contributions. If you have any queries or wish to connect, do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting!
